        Africaâ€™s cities are growing rapidly â€” but along with skyscrapers and roads comes a loss of greenery. Urban greening initiatives are now sprouting in cities like Nairobi, Accra, and Lagos to counteract this trend, proving that trees donâ€™t belong only in rural areas.
      </p>

      <p>
        Local councils, youth groups, and residents are turning empty plots and road medians into mini forests. Shade trees are being planted in parks, schools, and marketplaces to cool down streets and improve air quality.
      </p>

      <p>
        In Nairobiâ€™s informal settlements, community gardens with tree borders help clean the air and provide fruit. In Accra, schoolyards are being lined with neem and baobab trees â€” not only for shade, but for learning.
      </p>

      <p>
        These efforts create more than green spaces. They lower urban heat, reduce flooding, and reconnect people to nature. With smart planning and public support, African cities are proving that concrete and canopies can coexist.
