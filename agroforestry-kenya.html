      <p>
        In Kenyaâ€™s rural landscapes, farmers are embracing a transformative approach to agriculture â€” one that merges traditional farming with ecological restoration. Known as <strong>agroforestry</strong>, this method integrates trees into farming systems, offering a sustainable solution to land degradation, food insecurity, and climate change.
      </p>

      <p>
        Agroforestry is not new to Kenya. Indigenous communities have long recognized the value of growing trees alongside crops. But today, with modern knowledge and growing climate pressures, this ancient practice is making a comeback â€” and changing lives in the process.
      </p>

      <p>
        Farmers now plant trees like Grevillea, Leucaena, and Moringa among their maize and bean fields. These trees not only provide shade and enrich the soil, but also supply fruits, firewood, and fodder for livestock. The result is higher crop yields, restored soil fertility, and better resilience against drought.
      </p>

      <p>
        With support from NGOs and government initiatives, thousands of farmers are receiving training in tree nursery development, composting, and water conservation techniques. Agroforestry is proving especially powerful for women and youth, who are turning small plots of land into thriving green enterprises.
      </p>

      <p>
        In regions like Kisumu and Machakos, farmers are witnessing firsthand how planting trees can restore not just the land, but hope and stability. The green canopy is spreading â€” and with it, the promise of a more food-secure and sustainable future.
