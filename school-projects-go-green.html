        Across the continent of Africa, a quiet revolution is happening in classrooms and playgrounds. From Nairobi to Abuja, children are stepping into leadership roles â€” not in politics or business, but in protecting our planet.

        Through eco-clubs and school-led planting campaigns, young students are learning how to care for the earth, starting with something simple: planting a tree. Many schools now have small nurseries where students raise seedlings, water plants, and monitor their growth.

        In rural areas, schools are integrating environmental education into the curriculum. Children learn about the importance of biodiversity, how forests affect rainfall, and why deforestation harms both people and wildlife. These lessons go beyond the classroom â€” kids are bringing the message home and inspiring entire families to take action.
      </p>

        One standout example is in Uganda, where students plant trees on their birthdays â€” a tradition thatâ€™s both fun and symbolic. In Tanzania, schoolyard gardens double as food sources and tree learning centers. And in South Africa, digital tools are helping students map reforested zones using smartphones.
      </p>

      <p>
        The future of Africa's forests rests in the hands of its youngest citizens. And thanks to these school-led green projects, itâ€™s a future full of hope, growth, and resilience.
