        In the face of rising deforestation, Nigerian communities are fighting back â€” not with protest signs, but with shovels, seedlings, and a mission to restore their forests. Reforestation initiatives are gaining momentum, as farmers, elders, youth groups, and local leaders unite to bring trees back to the land.

        Northern Nigeria has long suffered from desert encroachment, while southern regions have lost large swaths of rainforest due to logging and agriculture. But change is happening. In states like Kaduna, Plateau, and Enugu, community members are planting indigenous trees like Iroko, Mahogany, and Gmelina to revive the lost biodiversity and combat erosion.
      </p>

        These projects donâ€™t just help the planet â€” they provide tangible benefits. Restored forests mean cooler climates, cleaner air, improved water retention, and new sources of food and income. Fruit-bearing trees like mango and guava also support nutrition and local markets.
      </p>

      <p>
        NGOs and government programs are offering training on seed collection, nursery management, and sustainable harvesting. In places like Ibadan and Abuja, school children are now growing trees on campuses as part of their environmental science programs â€” creating a ripple effect across generations.
      </p>

      <p>
        With over 100 million hectares of degraded land, Nigeriaâ€™s journey is just beginning. But one seed, one tree, one community at a time â€” the forests are coming back.
