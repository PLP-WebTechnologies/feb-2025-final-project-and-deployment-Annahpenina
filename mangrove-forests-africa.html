        Along Africaâ€™s coasts â€” from the Niger Delta to the shores of Mozambique â€” mangrove forests serve as powerful protectors. These salt-tolerant trees form dense networks along coastlines, acting as natural barriers against storms, floods, and erosion.

        Sadly, many mangroves have been destroyed by construction and pollution. But communities are taking action. In Senegal, women-led cooperatives are restoring mangroves by planting thousands of seedlings in tidal zones. In Nigeria, conservation teams train locals to manage fish nurseries within mangrove systems.

        The benefits are vast. Mangroves support fisheries, trap carbon, and provide timber. They also safeguard biodiversity â€” offering shelter to crabs, birds, and countless marine species.
      </p>

      <p>
        With rising sea levels threatening coastal towns, restoring mangrove forests is now a climate priority. African communities are proving that the best line of defense comes not from concrete walls, but from living roots.
